## Run the System
Docker will pull the images (if our machine does not have it before).
Step 1 : run command:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Step 2 : acess to page:
access the frontend url using route `http://localhost:3001/`.
access the backend url using route `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
