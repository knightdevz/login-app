## Run the System
Docker will pull the images (if our machine does not have it before).

Step 1 : run command:
```bash

```

Step 2 : access to page:

Frontend url using route: 
```bash
http://localhost:3001

## Stop the System
Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:
```bash
docker-compose down
```
